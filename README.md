# NevinhaJS

## What's NevinhaJS?
NevinhaJS is a component render based in [React](https://reactjs.org/) but beyond of static methods and component lifecycles (including state and props), we also have methods for make some animations and improve the UX.

**NevinhaJS uses the virtual DOM as base of  their diff.**

Actually we're implementing new features and animations to make this framework more powerfull and sexy for using it in your projects.
