# NevinhaJS

## What's NevinhaJS?
A component render as [React](https://reactjs.org/) that goes beyond static methods and component lifecycles, including state, props and improving the way you make meaningful animations, providing an amazing experience that helps you to become a professional deleloper in future.


> ðŸš¨ Importants Notes
> - **NevinhaJS uses the virtual DOM as base of  their diff.**
> - **NevinhaJS uses CSS Typed OM API, which improves arround 30% the performance of your browser's css manipulations. You can learn more in this [google article](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/03/cssom#customprops)**

Actually, we're implementing new features and animations to make this framework more powerful and sexy for your projects.

  }

  customEvent(){
    console.log('this is a custom event')
  }

  render() {
    const {name} = this.state;
    const {customEvent} = this.props;

    return (
      <div>
          <SomeNevinhaComponent />

          <AnotherComponent>
            <p>Don't forget to declare this component, because it wasn't declared yet</p>
          </AnotherComponent>

          // Yeah it has some effects inside our architecture,
          // you just need to call the effect name  ðŸ˜‰
          <h1 fadeIn>
            <p>Hello! This is the new: {name}</p>
            {name}
