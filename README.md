# NevinhaJS

## What's NevinhaJS?
A component render as [React](https://reactjs.org/)  that goes beyond of static methods and component lifecycles, including state, props,  improving the way you make meaningful animations and providing an amazing experience.


> ðŸš¨ Importants Notes
> - **NevinhaJS uses the virtual DOM as base of  their diff.**
> - **NevinhaJS uses CSS Typed OM API, wich improves arround 30% of the performance of your browser css manipulations. You can see more details in this [google article](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/03/cssom#customprops)**

Actually we're implementing new features and animations to make this framework more powerful and sexy for using it in your projects.

## Install
We'll put NevinhaJS in [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) as son as possible.

## Usage

With a bundler module as a [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) or [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), use:

```javascript
// using ES6 modules
import {NevinhaComponent, render} from 'nevinha-js';

class App extends NevinhaComponent {
  constructor(){
    super();
    this.state.name = "NevinhaJS"
  }

  customEvent(){
    console.log('this is a custom event')
  }

  render() {
    const {name} = this.state;
    const {customEvent} = this.props;

    return (
      <div>
          <SomeNevinhaComponent />

          <AnotherComponent>
            <p>Don't forget to declare this component, because it wasn't declared yet</p>
          </AnotherComponent>

          // Yeah it has some effects inside our architecture,
          // you just need to call the effect name  ðŸ˜‰
          <h1 fadeIn>
            <p>Hello! This is the new: {name}</p>
            {name}
          </h1>

          <AnotherComponentWithProps myEvent={customEvent} myProp="anything" />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
